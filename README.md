🌐 Tech Stack:

Python (Flask for backend API)

SQLite (database)

OpenRouter + Mistral-7B-Instruct (for natural language → SQL conversion)

Postman (for API testing)

📄 Key Features:

Ask human-style questions (e.g., “Which product had the highest ROAS?”)

Automatic SQL query generation and execution

JSON API response format for integration or dashboards

📁 Deliverables:

app.py (Flask server code)

SQLite DB (ecommerce.db)

All mapped CSV files

Sample API requests

Video demo (optional)
